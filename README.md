# Oven functionality
 Final exam task in Embedded class
 
 # Description
Imitate a real oven functionality in C by the use of Arduino Nano microcontroller and the specially designed I/O board. Some folders or files may be called "Stopwatch" due to re-used code from previous exercises. Don't be confused by that :)
